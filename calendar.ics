DESCRIPTION:The Albanese government has been caught out again lying about their arms trade with Israel.\nDespite claims to the contrary\, an FOI request has revealed that it signed and vetted all stages of a $900 million contract with Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems\, which manufactures drones used to kill Palestinians in Gaza.\nSeeking to divert attention from its complicity with Israel’s Gaza genocide\, the Albanese government has backed a report by arch Zionist and antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal that proposed a widespread crackdown on protests opposing Israel’s Gaza genocide.\nThe Special Envoy’s Plan to Combat Antisemitism proposes that all levels of government adopt the widely discredited IHRA definition of antisemitism\, which has been used to silence legitimate criticism of Israel and Zionism.\nIt advocates surveillance\, censorship\, and punitive control over the funding of cultural and educational institutions: measures straight out of Trump’s authoritarian playbook.\nWe call on the Australian government to:\n– repudiate the Special Envoy’s Plan\n– sack Jillian Segal\n– implement sanctions on Israel\, including a comprehensive arms embargo.
